String++

String++ is a lightweight and modular string manipulation library for C++. It seeks to replicate the greater string functionality provided by languages such as Java and Python.

Lightweight

- With the full String++ library weighing in at just over 300 lines, you get exactly what you need, and that's it.

Modular

- Only need one or two functions? Take them. String++ was built with this in mind, every function is written entirely independent from the rest of the library.
